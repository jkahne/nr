        <h6>Strategy and Leadership</h6>
        <p>
        We don't want to be just another hired gun for you.  We want our relationship to be built on solid communication and trust.  To facilitate this, we need to learn to work together to avoid the typical miscommunication between businesses and consultancies  that end in panic. This can be avoided by following a few simple to understand principals. These principals will also allow you to remove process bottlenecks, align teams, and better see the stream of value produced by our collective team.
