<p>I like to write Ruby using Vim to create Rails applications for you on my Mac.</p>
<p>I work best with small teams and I care about producing the best software. To me, that means    more than simply checking off items on the todo list.  That's the type of service that is all too prevalen   t in this industry. I like producing solid code that is designed for your users in mind.  If the end produc   t isn't usable, friendly, and stable then it isn't finished.  </p>
<p>I like working with end users to discuss what they truly want out of their systems and keepi   ng everyone in the loop on the progress of the work. Constant communication and feedback are vitally necess   ary in producing successful software.</p>

You and your users like to discuss what you truly want out of your systems and want to have insight into h    ow everything is progressing. Constant communication and feedback are vitally necessary in producing succe    ssful software. We prefer to use Kanban boards to let everyone vizualize where every task stands.

You embrace agile development methodologies and want to be listened to and colloraborted with to create th    e best possible outcome.  You want us to do more than "hit the bullet points" like what most consultancies     deliver. If the end product isn't usable, friendly, and stable then it isn't finished.

#### Staff Augmentation

I can also help your team if you already have a vision and simply need an additional hand. Or, if you need     to get a handle on your development processes, I can

#### Strategy

- figure out what *not* to work on is as important as what to work on.
- prioritize the highest value work and work at a consistent pace providing production ready code every [2    ?] week[s].







#### Technical Leadership

- Remove bottlenecks (organizationally as well as technical reasons holding you back)
  - Small steps make a huge difference.

  User interaction can be streamlined by Noticing Everyday Pain that customers experience and pay attention     to it at every step of the process. However, finding the common ground of all user activities is what shou    ld be designed for, not individual preferences.



### How We Work

  We prefer to be adaptive when it comes to plans instead of trying to have everything mapped out on a Gaant     chart months before.

  We prefer to work on the highest feature set of value at any given time.


  We prefer to be able to change what we're working on because you changed you mind mid-process instead of c    onforming to a document that was written months ago when we all knew less.

##### Jeremy Kahne

I'm Jeremy and I'm the owner of Nimble River where I get to do what I love for a living.

Prior to consulting, I was brought on as  CTO of a national organization that securely processed transcrip    ts and diplomas for thousands of institutions to get their technology strategy back on track.

When not hacking on code or improving processes, I enjoy spending time camping &amp; hiking, lifting &amp;     running,  playing board games, drawing, and generally being a nerd.

I work in my home office in Cincinnati, OH where I have entirely too many Lego sets sitting on my shelves.
